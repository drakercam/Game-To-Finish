# Project Idea

This is an early prototype for a item collecting game I am creating. I want to implement various enemies in the (soon to be) for available areas that fight the player to stop them from collecting resources. These resources can then be brought back to the main area to sell which with this money you can upgrade various player stats such as: Health, Physical Damage, Armor, Projectile Damage, Defense

Now since this is such an early protype the idea for the game might change, but the core aspects is I want to implement item collecting, shop vending, and some sort of upgrade system.

My plan is to upload this game to itch.io as my very first solo published game
